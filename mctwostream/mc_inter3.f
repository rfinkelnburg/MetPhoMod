*=  The input data are given on a set of bins (representing the integral     =*
*=  of the input quantity over the range of each bin) and are being matched  =*
*=  onto another set of bins (target grid).  A typical example would be an   =*
*=  input data set spcifying the extra-terrestrial flux on wavelength inter- =*
*=  vals, that has to be matched onto the working wavelength grid.           =*
*=  The resulting area in a given bin of the target grid is calculated by    =*
*=  simply adding all fractional areas of the input data that cover that     =*
*=  particular target bin.                                                   =*
*=  Some caution should be used near the endpoints of the grids.  If the     =*
*=  input data do not span the full range of the target grid, the area in    =*
*=  the "missing" bins will be assumed to be zero.  If the input data extend =*
*=  beyond the upper limit of the target grid, the user has the option to    =*
*=  integrate the "overhang" data and fold the remaining area back into the  =*
*=  last target bin.  Using this option is recommended when re-gridding      =*
*=  vertical profiles that directly affect the total optical depth of the    =*
